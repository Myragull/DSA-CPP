cin.get();

Feature	

while Loop	
Use Case	
When you donâ€™t know how many times to run (e.g., until user presses q)
Structure	
Condition is separate, update must be written manually
Risk
Less risk because update is part of the loop
Flexibility	
Cleaner for counting loops

for Loop
Use Case
When you know exactly how many times to run (e.g., print first 10 numbers)
Structure	
Everything (start, condition, update) is in one line
Risk	
Forgetting update can cause infinite loop	
Flexibility	
More flexible (good for event-driven loops)
